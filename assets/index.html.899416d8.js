Specifically, this refers to collaborative spaces such as meeting rooms or research labs, which are instrumented with interactive technologies. The distinctive features of DataChopin are the use of a large-scale display wall as a shared desktop, as well as flexible composition mechanisms for incremental construction of visualisations. The available display space supports multiple, simultaneous users, who are free to roam in front of the display and contribute to the analysis at any time.</p><h3 id="massive-networks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#massive-networks" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Massive Networks</h3><p><img class="object-cover h-80 w-full shadow-lg shadow-black/50" src="'+p+'"></p><p>Massive Networks is a project that explores the use of high-end visualisation systems for interactive analysis of very large and complex networks. The interface suports a variety of common analytics tasks, such as selection, filtering, layout changes, and summarisation. Furthermore, it was recently extended to support graph visualisaiton using non-euclidean geometry. As such, it is well suited for high-end visualisation systems, which come in a wide variety of display sizes and shapes.</p><h3 id="genomics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#genomics" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Genomics</h3><p><img class="object-cover h-80 w-full shadow-lg shadow-black/50" src="'+m+'"></p><p>The genomics project visualises gene expressions accross the entire human genome. It utilises a unique dataset compiled by researchers at UNSW&#39;s Children&#39;s Cancer Institute that allows to observe changes in gene expressions over time. The resulting amount of data is very large and overwhelms conventional genomics tools. Consequently, it is a great example of data analytics that requires the capabilities of high-end visualisation systems.</p><h3 id="biodive" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#biodive" aria-hidden="true">#</a> BioDIVE</h3><p><img class="object-cover h-80 w-full shadow-lg shadow-black/50" src="'+u+'"></p><p>BioDIVE is a research prototype developed to visualise changes in cell morphology. It comprises a set of bespoke visualisations that integrate bio-images and derived quantitative data, enabling deeper comprehension and seamless interaction with multi-dimensional cellular information. The multivariate dataset contains 52 microscopy image-derived parameters. This information is visualised in an immersive 3d environment through several dimension reduction techniques.</p><h2 id="publications" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#publications" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Publications</h2><p>You can learn more about research projects that I have worked on in my various academic publications.
